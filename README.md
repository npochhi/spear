Spear
==============================

The Spear library provides reference implementations of adversarial attacks using PyTorch. It was designed to benchmark adversarial defence methods.


The library contains implementations of the following adversarial attacks:
* Fast Gradient Sign Method ([Goodfellow et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572))
* DeepFool ([Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04599))
* Basic Iterative Method ([Kurakin et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533))
