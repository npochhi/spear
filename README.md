Spear
==============================

The Spear library provides reference implementations of adversarial attacks using PyTorch. It was designed to benchmark adversarial defence methods.


The library contains implementations of the following adversarial attacks:
* Fast Gradient Sign Method ([Goodfellow et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6572))
* DeepFool ([Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04599))
* Basic Iterative Method ([Kurakin et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533))
* Carlini Wagner Attack with L2 norm ([Carlini and Wagner, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04644))
* Projected Gradient Descent ([Madry et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083))
* Momentum Iterative - Fast Gradient Sign Method([Dong et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06081))
